# Arithmetic Expression Trees

Arithmetic expression trees are mathematical expressions represented
through their order of operations hierarchy. In this case, we've
represented several possible scenarios in XML files:

- [All Safe Operators](all-safe-operations-tree.xml) (+, -, *, /)
- [Divide by Zero](divide-by-zero-tree.xml)
- [Negative Subtraction](negative-subtraction-tree.xml)
- [Single Value](single-value-tree.xml)
